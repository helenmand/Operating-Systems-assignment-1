2nd exercise is a bash script that downloads git repos and checks wether it follows a specific structure, it also print the number of directories,txt files and other files.

3rd exercise is a bash script that counts word occurances of a txt file (books by Gutenberg project) and prints the n (given by the user) most frequent words in that txt file.
